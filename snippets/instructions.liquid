  instruction:"Some glazes can naturally deflocculate (thinn). A side effect of this is that the glaze no longer holds its suspension well. It quickly sinks to the bottom of the bucket. If left unused for a long time, the ingredients can form a hard layer that you can no longer stir.

  Pour the water into a clean bucket and scrape off the hard cake with a scraper. Slowly add the glaze chunks to the water in the other bucket and stir or mix thoroughly. Measure the specific gravity and viscosity. The glaze may need to be thickened with Epsom salts. This will prevent it from settling, making it easier to stir next time.",

  instruction:"If you don't use a glaze for a while, it can crystallize slightly, especially due to temperature fluctuations. These crystals are recognizable as small grains or pebbles in the glaze. Strain the glaze and collect the small grains. Scrape them out of the strainer and place them in a small jar. Fill it with a small amount of hot water. The grains will dissolve. Add this solution back to the glaze.",

  instruction:"Een gebarsten glazuurlaag betekent altijd een te dik gelegde glazuurlaag. Dat kan drie oorzaken hebben:

  het soortelijk gewicht van het glazuur is te hoog

  de viscositeit van het glazuur is te hoog (doorlooptijd te lang)

  de contacttijd van het glazuur met de biscuit gebakken scherf is te lang

  Controleer dus zeker het soortelijk gewicht en de viscositeit. Als deze in orde zijn, probeer sneller te werken. De biscuitbaktemperatuur verhogen kan ook helpen bij zeer poreuze kleisoorten die veel water aanzuigen. ",

  Overly powdery glazes can also indicate a glaze that's too deflocculated. Be sure to check the viscosity with a flow cup. If it's too low and the flow time is too short, you'll need to thicken the glaze with a saturated solution of Epsom salts.",

  instruction:"
  A glaze drips in one or more of these cases:

  the glaze has been applied too thickly to the shard by keeping it in contact with the biscuit-fired shard for too long or by brushing on too many layers

  the glaze is too viscous, so it was applied too thickly to the shard

  the specific gravity of the glaze is too high

  the glaze was fired too high.

  Be sure to check the specific gravity and viscosity. These should match the packaging. Glaze quickly and efficiently, and don't layer too many layers. Monitor your kiln's heat output using melting cones.

{%

  field_id:"backedNotColoredInstruction",
  instruction:"
  Most SOGO glazes are vibrant, multi-shaded. These glazes look completely different depending on how thin or thick they are. For example, Pacific Blue turns brown if applied too thinly and orange-yellow if applied very thickly, with a variety of blue shades in between.

  Always check the specific gravity and viscosity before glazing. Get to know the specific glaze. Perform tests with short and long contact times to determine the possible color variations.

  Be sure to check out the photos of the glaze in question in the webshop. They show examples of thin versus thick glaze layers.

  The clay used also plays a significant role in the color development. Some glazes look completely different on red clay compared to white. An example of this is shown in the webshop for each glaze.

  instruction:"
  A glossy glaze only shines when it's sufficiently melted. Is your glaze matte? Then it hasn't received enough heat work. SOGO glazes are ideally fired on melting cone 7. Monitor the firing with melting cones. Place cones on all levels of the kiln.

  A glaze can also be dull if it's applied too thinly. You'll then actually see and feel the underlying shard. In that case, be sure to check the specific gravity and viscosity and adjust as needed. Apply sufficient layers or adjust the contact time between the glaze and the shard.

  Glazes creep away when they:

  the viscosity is too high

  It is more common on flat items such as plates or the bottom of bowls and dishes.

  Be sure to check the specific gravity and viscosity. Glaze smoothly and efficiently. Don't let the glaze remain in contact with the shard for too long.
