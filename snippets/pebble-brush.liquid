  instruction:"If you don't use a glaze for a while, it can crystallize slightly, especially due to temperature fluctuations. These crystals are recognizable as small grains or pebbles in the glaze. Strain the glaze and collect the small grains. Scrape them out of the strainer and place them in a small jar. Fill it with a small amount of hot water. The grains will dissolve. Add this solution back to the glaze.",
