  instruction:"
  Chamotte in clay can cause pinpricks. A viscous glaze doesn't always adhere well to the small holes and crevices present in chamotte-containing clay. Air gets trapped in these grooves, sometimes leaving a hole in the glaze surface. Be careful not to sponge too much when turning and to smooth the clay surface with a rubber lumber. This will significantly help prevent chamotte-related pinpricks.

  If it's just a single pinprick, an unevenness in the clay surface could be the cause. Is the entire area covered in pinpricks? Contact me, and we'll investigate the cause. Pinpricks are a very complex problem.

{%

  field_id:"backedColoredInstruction",
  instruction:"
  Colored clay contains coloring oxides such as iron oxide, manganese oxide, and/or cobalt oxide. These lose oxygen atoms when fired at high enough temperatures. This creates gas in a glaze. If the stoneware glaze is already solidifying (due to cooling), these gas bubbles can leave pinpricks and craters.

  One solution might be to bake the biscuit slowly and high enough (at least 950°C but higher might be beneficial).
