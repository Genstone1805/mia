The glaze may be quite runny, but this consistency will give you the desired results. Try using the glaze this way. If you're still not satisfied and the result looks too thin, try increasing the contact time with the shard.",

  instruction:"The finger-dip method provides an initial indication of viscosity but requires considerable experience. Moreover, subtle differences cannot be detected with this method. Furthermore, some SOGO glazes perform better when thicker, while others perform better when thinned.

  So measure the viscosity with a flow cup (available in the webshop) to be sure of the correct thickness.

  You can always deflocculate the glaze slightly with Dolapix to thin it out. Note: some SOGO glazes need to be quite viscous (syrupy) to achieve beautiful, deep colors.",
